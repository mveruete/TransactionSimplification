# TransactionSimplification
Algorithm for simplifying T transactions between N users.


## Basic description 


## Cloud Deployment 

[Here](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/2d8bdd6e-f48c-4c34-8ad7-854e1b08ab1a?fbclid=IwAR2x8yOWOkIOtHe8aUba_8H2h7WmrgoPXe3ZNMSQ71sIqe2aGwQD-YpXcb8) you can find a preview of what the code does. For simplicity the number of users and transactions is bounded, but the code works for an arbitrary number of both. 

Additionally, in order to understand better the final results I have fixed a "random seed" such that the random graph obtained is the same. You can choose a different random seed in the bottom part of the GUI.
